Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges:

* Figuring out how sort and understanding how that works.

* Not using for loops like that in this assignment I had to find alternatives.

* Understanding decomposition of objects.

* Understanding how to use ... in javascript.

* Also figuring out how to put icons that isn't images in my code I tried awesome font and many other things and then I figured out that I could also use unicode emoji's as as well.
